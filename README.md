# 🔁 Binary ↔ Decimal Converter

🚀 **Live Demo**: [Check it out on Render!](https://bin2dec-number-system-converter.onrender.com)

Welcome to a lightweight yet powerful web app that makes converting between **binary and decimal numbers** a breeze! Built using **Flask (Python), HTML, and CSS**, this tool is perfect for students, developers, and techies who deal with binary logic or number systems.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

When you visit the app:

* 🏠 The **Home Page** presents you with two simple buttons:

  * **Convert Binary to Decimal**: Enter binary values (0s and 1s) and get the decimal equivalent.
  * **Convert Decimal to Binary**: Type any decimal number and watch it transform into binary.
* 🚫 The app validates input instantly — no 2s to 9s allowed in binary!
* ✅ If valid, the converted result is displayed in a styled output box.

All routing and backend logic is handled smoothly using **Flask**, and the UI is cleanly styled with Bootstrap and custom CSS.
